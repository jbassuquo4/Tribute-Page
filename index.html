    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Frank Sinatra's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1933</strong> - Gets his baptism at St. Francis Church"
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1935</strong> - Sinatra attended David E. Rue Jr. High School"
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1937</strong> - Sinatra attended A. J. Demarest High School (since renamed as Hoboken High
            School), where he arranged bands for school dances. He left without graduating, having attended only 47
            days before being expelled for "general rowdiness".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1938</strong> - Sinatra got his first break when his mother persuaded a local singing group, the
            3 Flashes, to let him join.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1941</strong> - Sinatra found employment as a singing waiter at a roadhouse called "The Rustic
            Cabin" in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, for which he was paid $15 a week.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1942</strong> - Saxophone player Frank Mane, who knew Sinatra from Jersey City radio station
            WAAT where both performed on live broadcasts, arranged for him to audition and record "Our Love", his
            first solo studio recording
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1944</strong> - He made his first public appearance with the band at the Coronado Theatre in
            Rockford, Illinois, opening the show with "Stardust".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1945</strong> - Dorsey bade farewell to Sinatra, reportedly saying as Sinatra left, "I hope you
            fall on your ass".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1953</strong> - Sinatra released "I Couldn't Sleep a Wink Last Night" as a single and recorded
            his own version of Crosby's "White Christmas", and the following year he released "I Dream of You (More
            Than You Dream I Do)", "Saturday Night (Is the Loneliest Night of the Week)", "Dream", and "Nancy (with
            the Laughing Face)" as singles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1962</strong> - He was performing at the Kauai County Fair in Hawaii. Sinatra's relationship
            with Columbia Records was also disintegrating, with A&R executive Mitch Miller claiming he "couldn't give
            away" the singer's records. Though several notable recordings were made during this time period, such as
            "If I Could Write a Book" in January 1952, which Granata sees as a "turning point", forecasting his later
            work with its sensitivity, Columbia and MCA dropped him later that year.
      </li>
      <li><strong>1970</strong> - Nice 'n' Easy, a collection of ballads, topped the Billboard chart and remained
            in the charts for 86 weeks, winning critical plaudits. Granata noted the "lifelike ambient sound" quality
            of Nice and Easy, the perfection in the stereo balance, and the "bold, bright and snappy" sound of the
            band. He highlighted the "close, warm and sharp" feel of Sinatra's voice, particularly on the songs
            "September in the Rain", "I Concentrate on You", and "My Blue Heaven".</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1983</strong> - In an effort to maintain his commercial viability in the late 1960s, Sinatra
            would record works by Paul Simon ("Mrs. Robinson"), the Beatles ("Yesterday"), and Joni Mitchell ("Both
            Sides, Now").
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1984</strong> - Sinatra was embroiled in controversy when he worked a ten-day engagement for $2
            million in Sun City, in the internationally unrecognized Bophuthatswana, breaking a cultural boycott
            against apartheid-era South Africa. President Lucas Mangope awarded Sinatra with the highest honor, the
            Order of the Leopard, and made him an honorary tribal chief.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2005</strong> - Sinatra became less outspoken on racial issues when he changed his political
            affiliations. Though he did much towards civil rights causes, it did not stop the occasional racial jibe
            from him and the other Rat Pack members toward Davis at concerts.
      </li>
      <li><strong>2009</strong> - Sinatra died with his wife at his side at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los
            Angeles, aged 82, after a heart attack.</li>
